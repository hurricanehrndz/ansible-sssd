* Using service settings

The multiple ways to declare services settings allow you to set them from multiple sources.
The final set of options that will be applied is the results of the merge of the following dicts in this respective order :

* the global defaults sssd__services_settings_default[service_name]
* the global user settings sssd__services_settings[service_name]
* the specific defaults sssd__services_[service_name]_settings_default
* the specific user settings sssd__services_[service_name]_settings_default

* Using domain settings

In an analog way than services, the multiple ways to declare domains follow the following merge order :

* the global defaults sssd__domains_settings[domain_name]
* the global user settings sssd__domains_[domain_name]_settings

## Facts

By default the local fact are installed and expose the following variables :

* ```ansible_local.sssd.version_full```
* ```ansible_local.sssd.version_major```


## Example

### Playbook

Use it in a playbook as follows:

```yaml
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - turgon37.sssd
```

### Inventory

  - pam
  - ssh
sssd__services_settings:
  nss:
    homedir_substring: /home
